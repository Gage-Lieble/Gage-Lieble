I'm a software developer who is always striving to learn new technologies! You take a look through my Github Repo's to see my progress so far if you'd like. Some languages I enjoyed learning so far include Django, Python, Javascript, VueJs as well as the basics, html and css. With these various technologies I've built fullstack applications that use django to pull API's, handle account systems, save data, and keep values secure. While I use Django mainly for backend, I used Javsctipt to add functionality to the frontend as well.
